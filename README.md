## Exercise-6-Factorial

# Exercise was to write a Python script containing a function called factorial() that takes a single input/argument which is a positive integer and returns its factorial. The factorial of a number is that number multiplied by all of the positive numbers less than it. For example, the factorial of 5 is 5x4x3x2x1 which equals 120. You should, in your script, test the function by calling it with the values 5, 7, and 10.

# First I wrote code to get the factorial of 5. Once I was happy with my logic and maths, I then changed the script to alow for range 1 to 20. 
# 08/04/18: Having got it working I had forgotten until tonight to then go back and redo the exercise using factorial.
